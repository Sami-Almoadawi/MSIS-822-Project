## 📖 Project Overview

This repository includes the code and tools for distinguishing between **AI-generated and human-written Arabic literature** with a hybrid approach that integrates stylistic features and deep semantic embeddings.  
The system incorporates sophisticated **Arabic preprocessing**, **sentence-transformer embeddings**, and a collection of **machine learning/deep learning classifiers** for enhanced performance.

---
## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a robust binary classification model to detect AI-generated Arabic text.
- Extract linguistic, statistical, and stylometric features specific to the Arabic language.
- Leverage **AraBERT** for extracting semantic embeddings.
- Compare the performance of traditional Machine Learning models (RF, SVM, XGBoost) vs. Deep Learning approaches.

#  Task Description

The assignment is defined as a binary classification problem:

- **1 — Authored by humans**
- **0 — Generated by AI**

 Each Arabic abstract is processed, encoded into embeddings, then categorised utilising one of many trained models.
 The research tackles the increasing difficulty of automatically detecting created Arabic academic literature.
 The code is divided into 4 Phases based on the original script:
1. **Phase 1:** Data Acquisition & Initial Exploration (Stats, Visuals).
2. **Phase 2:** Data Preprocessing (Normalization, Stemming) & EDA.
3. **Phase 3:** Feature Engineering (Stylometric features 6, 29, 52, 75 + BERT L2-Norm).
4. **Phase 4:** Modeling (ML Classifiers + Neural Network) & Evaluation.

#  ⚙️ Methodology
The pipeline consists of four main phases:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - **Normalization:** Unicode normalization, remove non-Arabic chars, tanween, Persian chars, hamza variants, and alif maqsura.
   - **Diacritics Removal:** Remove all tashkeel (fatha, damma, kasra, shadda, etc.).
   - **Stopwords Removal:** Filter Arabic stopwords using NLTK corpus.
   - **Stemming:** ISRI stemmer for Arabic word roots.

2. **Feature Engineering:**

   - **Stylometric Features:** Specific indices (6, 29, 52, 75) based on project assignment.

   - **Semantic Embeddings:** Using bert-base-arabertv02 to extract sentence-level embeddings (CLS token).

3. **Modeling:**

   - **Training ML classifiers:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost.

   - **Deep Learning:** Neural Network with Keras.

4. **Evaluation:**

   - **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

   - **Visualization:** Confusion Matrices and ROC Curves.

#  🔚 Conclusion & Future Work

This project explored AI-generated Arabic research abstract detection using a hybrid approach combining stylometric features and a BERT CLS scalar. Evaluated on the KFUPM-JRCAI corpus, various classifiers were tested, with **Random Forest** performing best in balancing recall and overall accuracy. Results indicate that integrating simple semantic signals from BERT can effectively aid Arabic AI-text detection. However, limitations include reliance on a single dataset and a basic BERT representation. Future research may enhance detection by utilising more advanced AraBERT representations and incorporating diverse Arabic datasets and features to improve performance on human texts and AI-generated content.
