#  Project Overview

This repository includes the code and tools for distinguishing between **AI-generated and human-written Arabic literature** with a hybrid approach that integrates stylistic features and deep semantic embeddings.  
The system incorporates sophisticated **Arabic preprocessing**, **sentence-transformer embeddings**, and a collection of **machine learning/deep learning classifiers** for enhanced performance.

#  Project Objectives

- Build a classification model to detect AI-generated Arabic text
- Extract linguistic and statistical features from Arabic text
- Compare performance of different machine learning models
- Achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between text types

# Project Structure
The code is divided into 4 Phases based on the original script:
1. **Phase 1:** Data Acquisition & Initial Exploration (Stats, Visuals).
2. **Phase 2:** Data Preprocessing (Normalization, Stemming) & EDA.
3. **Phase 3:** Feature Engineering (Stylometric features 6, 29, 52, 75 + BERT L2-Norm).
4. **Phase 4:** Modeling (ML Classifiers + Neural Network) & Evaluation.

#  Task Description

The assignment is defined as a binary classification problem:

- **1 — Authored by humans**
- **0 — Generated by AI**

 Each Arabic abstract is processed, encoded into embeddings, then categorised utilising one of many trained models.
 The research tackles the increasing difficulty of automatically detecting created Arabic academic literature.

#  Dataset Description

We use a large dataset of **41,940 Arabic research abstracts**, composed of:

- **original_abstract**: The original human-written Arabic abstract
- **{model}_generated_abstract** Machine-generated version from each model

### Dataset Statistics

| Subset | Count | Ratio |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Training | 29,358 | 70% |
| Validation | 6,291 | 15% |
| Testing | 6,291 | 15% |
| Total Samples | 41,940 | 100% |
| Classes | 0 (AI), 1 (Human) | 2

Each entry contains:

- `abstract_text`  
- `generated_by`  
- `source_split`  
- `label`  

The dataset is **balanced**, guaranteeing consistent model performance.

#  Methodology

- **Normalization:** Unicode normalization, remove non-Arabic chars, tatweel, Persian chars, hamza variants.
- **Diacritics Removal:** Remove all tashkeel (fatha, damma, kasra, shadda, etc.).
- **Stopwords Removal:** Filter Arabic stopwords using NLTK corpus.
- **Stemming:** ISRI stemmer for Arabic word roots.

#  Classification Models

- **Logistic Regression** - Baseline linear model
- **Random Forest** - Ensemble of decision trees
- **Gradient Boosting** - Iterative tree enhancement
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Optimal hyperplane separator
- **Neural Network** - Multi-layer deep learning model

#  Conclusion & Future Work
This project explored AI-generated Arabic research abstract detection using a hybrid approach combining stylometric features and a BERT CLS scalar. Evaluated on the KFUPM-JRCAI corpus, various classifiers were tested, with **Random Forest** performing best in balancing recall and overall accuracy. Results indicate that integrating simple semantic signals from BERT can effectively aid Arabic AI-text detection. However, limitations include reliance on a single dataset and a basic BERT representation. Future research may enhance detection by utilising more advanced AraBERT representations and incorporating diverse Arabic datasets and features to improve performance on human texts and AI-generated content.
